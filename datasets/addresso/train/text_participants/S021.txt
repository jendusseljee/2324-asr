the boy is taking cookies.
The girl is saying "/. quiet.
The boy is falling off the stool.
The mother is drying dishes.
The water is running over the sink.
The curtains are blowing in the breeze.
.
The girl is putting her hand up to have him pass the cookies.
She's drying the dishes.
The water's running over.
It's splashing on the floor.
Well the window's open but that's not action.
That's the curtain blowing right?
I guess that's it.
He's passing her the cookies.
Did I say that?
And he's taking them out of the jar.
