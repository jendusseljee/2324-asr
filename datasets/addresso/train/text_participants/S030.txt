okay the little boy is on a stool about to fall.
The stool's about to upset.
And he has a cookie in each hand, about to hand one cookie to the little girl who is standing there with her hand reached up for the cookie.
And the water is running over into the sink.
And the lady is standing there drying a dish.
Two cups and a plate are on the counter there.
And out the window there's a walkway and you can see a window across from the walkway drapes.
What's happening you said, huh?
Okay that's what's happening I guess.
Thank /.
