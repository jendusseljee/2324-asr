Alright.
I see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar.
And he gave some to the little girl and she's eating some of the cookies.
And I guess this is mama and she's washing the dishes.
And she dropped a dish.
No she didn't drop a dish.
The water that she's washing the dishes with she let run.
And it's overflown.
That doesn't sound right.
Did it /? we forgot to turn off the spigot.
And so the water is running off onto the floor here.
And mom apparently is washing the dishes.
And here's this little boy stealing the cookies.
He's gonna fall because the four legged stool is gonna fall over with him and the cookie jar.
And mama's drying the dishes as usual for mamas if they don't have a husband that dries them or washes them or whatever.
Let's see now.
I guess there's more things I'm sposta see.
Let's see here now.
Oh and the water is flowing out of the sink they forgot to turn off whoever's doing the dishwashing.
Mom apparently here, she forgot to turn off the water and the water is spilling out onto the kitchen floor.
And the little girl has pushed over the stool with the boy that was reaching up to get the cookies.
Either she pushed it over or he fell over with it.
You_know it excuse me but you_know I was ...
