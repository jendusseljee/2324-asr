oh you want me to on that?
Oh okay looks like the mother is washing the dishes.
And the little boy is trying to get cookies up in the cookie jar.
And there's a little girl with him.
And oh the stool or what do you call it it looks like it's going to fall.
And that's about all I can see.
And I guess this is breakfast.
