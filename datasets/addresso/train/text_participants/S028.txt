washing /. washing dishes or wiping dishes.
The water's running over the sink.
The kid is stealing the cookies.
He's falling over on the stool.
The wind is blowing outside the window.
The girl is saying be quiet and looking for another cookie.
She is like Eve encouraging him to steal them you_know.
She's standing in a puddle.
She's thinking deeply about something I don't know what.
That's about all I see.
