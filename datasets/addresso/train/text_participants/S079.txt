Mhm.
There's a young boy going in a cookie jar.
And there's a young girl.
And I'm saying he's a boy because it's hard to tell anymore.
And he's in the cookie jar.
And there's a stool that he is on and it already is starting to fall over.
And so is the water in the sink is overflowing in the sink.
I don't know about this hickey here whether that's more than what I said.
Like the mother is near the girl.
And she has /. oh I can't think of the ... she has the she's trying to wipe dishes.
Oh and stop the water from going out.
