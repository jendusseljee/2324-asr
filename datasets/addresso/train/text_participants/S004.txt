are you ready?
Well the sink is overflowing.
Mother is standing in the water like a jerk.
She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk.
The boy is trying to get a cookie out_of the cookie jar but boy he's about to fall off the stool.
His sister has her finger up to her mouth like she's saying "/. shh.
To be quiet ". don't let mother know what you're doing.
And he's about to hand her a cookie.
But in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe.
The reason the water's flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously.
And I'm looking out through the window.
And I don't see anything going on out there.
I don't //. that's just a bush I'm presuming or a plum pudding.
I told you the stools about to go over.
In a moment there's going to be real chaos which will make what's going on in the picture look like nothing.
The cookie jar is full.
The lid is off the cookie jar.
And the //. do you want me to tell you all of those things?
The cabinet door has just swung open.
Stool is about to fall.
I guess I've just told you that.
With a terrible crash.
Mother is daydreaming.
She doesn't even know what's going on behind her.
I think that's very important and sometimes typical.
Seems to be all I can see.
