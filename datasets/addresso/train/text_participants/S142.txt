Boy over here standing on the stool.
It's falling over.
And a girl down below.
The boy's up there.
He's has a cookie jar up there.
He's putting cookies in.
And the thing's falling over.
Then there's the lady.
She's washing dishes and drying them.
And the sink is turned on and the water's running down and is running on the floor and she's standing in the water.
She's got a dress on and she's looking out past drapes down here.
And she's looking out through the window.
Looks like that boy's gonna fall over pretty soon.
