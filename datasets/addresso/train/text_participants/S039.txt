do I start?
The children are getting into the cookie jar which is high above the sink.
They have the lid off the cookie jar.
The boy has two in his hand and the girl is reaching up for them.
And the stool in which he's standing is about to upset.
Course the door is open to get the cookie jar.
The mother presumably is at the sink washing dishes.
And the sink is running over.
The water is splashing down on the floor.
There are two I suppose dry dishes on the sink.
She has one in her hand a plate that she is drying.
She has it on an apron.
The sink is below a window with a path out into a garden.
There's shrubbery to the left of the path.
And you can see beyond that another window.
And I don't know what that is whether those are flowers or weeds.
And oh this is part of the house.
You can see the roof of maybe an l of a house and the curtains.
That's about all.
The curtains are drawn back.
