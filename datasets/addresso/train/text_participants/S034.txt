Well this little boy is up on the stool taking cookies handing them down to his sister and she's telling him to be quiet and the stool is tipping over.
The mother is drying dishes.
The water is running into the sink and running over down onto the floor.
The wind must be blowing because the curtains look like they're ... the cabinet door is open.
Mother's standing in water.
That's it.
