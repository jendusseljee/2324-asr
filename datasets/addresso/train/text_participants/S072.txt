you mean right now tell you?
The boy is stealing cookies out_of the jar.
And he's on a stool that's falling down.
And the girl is laughing at him.
And the mother is washing dishes but she's preoccupied.
And the water is flowing over the sink.
And there's trouble galore.
The wind is blowing the curtains.
She is not paying any attention to her kids.
And the boy in addition to stealing he's trying to give the girl a cookie.
And the whole thing is going to collapse.
But aside from that they seem to be a fairly happy family.
