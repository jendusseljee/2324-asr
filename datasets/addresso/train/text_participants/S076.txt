mhm.
Mhm a_lot_of things are happening.
Yes the water's going over.
The water's overflowing.
And the little boy is slipping off the stool while he's trying to steal some cookies.
And the little girl is laughing at him and she's not happy one bit.
And the lady is drying the dishes and looking out the window.
It's beautiful out there.
It must be June.
I don't know but anyhow it looks like it's not winter.
And that's about all I can see.
