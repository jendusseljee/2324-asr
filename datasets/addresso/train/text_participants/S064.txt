The kids are swiping some cookies and a stool is upsetting.
And the girl's telling him to be quiet so his mother over there washing dishes and the sink's overflowing.
And the window's up.
And I don't see much more than that.
She's drying dishes.
Did you say action?
I about it.
Cookie jar lid's falling.
