action.
Alright.
A lady's drying dishes.
The boy was standing on a stool but the action is that the stool has slipped and he is falling.
And the girl has her hand raised reaching for a cookie.
And there's a_lot_of action in the sink here.
The water is flowing out.
She is apparently so daydreaming that she doesn't realize that the sink is overflowing.
Any more action?
Or is that enough action?
