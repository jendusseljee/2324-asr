well the girl is watching the boy go into the cookie jar.
He has a cookie in his hand.
He's on the stool.
The stool is falling.
The mother is drying dishes.
Has a plate in her hand.
Sink is overflowing.
There's water on the floor.
She's stepping in the water.
Something that's going on you said?
The little girl looks like she's motioning to the boy to be quiet.
And I don't know what else.
The woman's looking out the window.
The window's open.
