Well the boy's climbing a stool.
And it's gonna upset.
He's trying to get a cookie.
And the sink is running over.
The mother's drying a dish.
And the little girl is reaching up for a cookie.
Hmhunh.
The mother over there she's doing the dishes.
And the sink's running.
The boy's getting the cookies.
Stool's on that step.
Window's open.
Maybe the wind is blowing in.
