Everything that's going on okay.
Mother's wiping dishes.
The sink is overflowing.
The mother's looking out the window.
The little boy is getting cookies out_of the cookie jar.
The stool on which he is standing is tipping over.
And the little girl I think is asking for a cookie.
I did say the sink's overflowing.
Why isn't anybody doing anything about that?
There's dishes on the counter.
Isn't that it?
