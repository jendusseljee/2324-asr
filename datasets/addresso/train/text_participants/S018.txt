All of the action.
Just go ahead and tell you?
The mother is drying a plate.
And the sink is clogged and there's more water going over and it's splashing onto the floor.
And the boy's falling off the stool getting cookies from the cookie jar.
And the girl's putting her finger up to her lip which means I won't tell or something like that.
Shoes are getting wet in the mother.
I'm looking outside but I don't see it doing anything.
Snowy?
Doesn't have too much to tell with that.
That's about all the action I see is the water spilling over and the boy falling off the stool.
I don't know that snow is action.
I don't see it snowing.
It looked light out there.
I don't know.
