The cookie jar.
With the girl helping him.
But that isn't the right thing.
But their mother was there spilling water.
This wouldn't be the grandmother I guess.
It's the children.
Well I think he's going to fall pretty quick.
But she was helping.
He handed the cookies to his sister I guess.
Well it ... the mother was drying her dishes.
She better get the water off.
Well he might fall soon if he doesn't ... but he's careful.
I think so.
