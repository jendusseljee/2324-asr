well I see the mother doing the dishes.
The water running over in the sink.
The boy's taking cookies from the cookie jar and the stool is falling over and the little girl has her hands up to her mouth in other words to be quiet.
And the stool's falling.
Yeah that's it.
She has her hand up for him to pass her a cookie then be quiet.
Mother's ... the dishes in the sink //. yeah okay.
