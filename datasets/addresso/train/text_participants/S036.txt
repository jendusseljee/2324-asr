well for one thing this boy's on the stool getting cookies.
And his stool's about to fall.
And the little girl's reaching for some cookies.
She got her finger in her mouth.
The mother's drying dishes and water's running over.
Yeah and she drying dishes water's running over.
She's standing in water.
There's a sink there.
Plate and a cup.
Outside you can see outside there the walkway and hedges, a window, tree.
And the cookie jar would hafta be in the cupboard.
And there's a the counter on in the kitchen.
And the curtains.
And the window.
