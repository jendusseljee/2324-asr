I see a boy getting in the cookie jar.
He's handing cookies to his sister.
His sister is standing on the floor receiving the cookies.
The boy is standing on the stool and it is in the process of toppling over.
The cookie jar is quite full at the present time.
The lid is off the cookie jar.
The mother is standing at the kitchen sink.
She is wiping dishes.
The sink is overflowing.
The water is running onto the floor splashing onto the floor.
There are other dishes.
There's a dish and two other cups on the counter beside her.
Over the sink is a window with curtains.
And the window is open.
And outside there is a tree and grass and shrubbery in sight.
Also a path and a window into a garage or another portion of the house is visible.
