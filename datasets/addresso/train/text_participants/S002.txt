Somebody's getting cookies out_of the cookie jar, standing on a stool.
The stool's gonna tip over.
And the girl's saying "/. shh don't let somebody hear.
And the mother's drying dishes.
The water's running out into the floor.
Cups and plates are sitting on the counter.
You can look out the window and see the shrubbery.
The lid's sideways from the cookie jar.
The door is open on the cabinet.
Mother apparently doesn't really notice well enough.
Curtains are hanging on the window.
The window is open.
