Well start from the the ... how can I /? okay.
First the ... I can't x say what this is.
The cabinet door is open.
And the children are stealing the cookies.
And mama's not even looking.
And the boy falls or looks like he is gonna fall.
Maybe he don't .
And then mama's doing the dishes.
And she got all wet.
The sink the sink run over and everything's going haywire.
Oh mercy.
