well the children are climbing up and he's about to fall.
And he's getting cookies.
And she's telling him to sh be quiet so mother won't hear him getting up there.
And he's handing a cookie down to her.
She's washing the dishes.
And for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place.
I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them.
Maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes.
In other words it's ... she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it.
But I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling.
I think she would have turned.
Maybe dropped her dish.
But she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall.
And he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too.
And with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. threesome and the kitchen would be a mess.
