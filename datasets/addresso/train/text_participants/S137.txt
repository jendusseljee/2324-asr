the woman of the house is drying the dishes.
Her sink is overflowing.
The boy's stool is tipping.
He's taking cookies out_of a jar.
He's handing one to his sister.
And oh she's already dried some dishes right here I guess.
Well what is this honey?
I can't make that out.
It look like a ... oh action.
Oh â€¡ I'm sorry.
She's drying the dishes.
She's standing in water if that's action.
And the door is open where the cookies are.
They all have their shoes on.
Oh she's got an apron on over her dress.
Kind_of homely girl isn't she?
She's not doing much she's just got her hand like.
How many did I get wrong?
Okay.
