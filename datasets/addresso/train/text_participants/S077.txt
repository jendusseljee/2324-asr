Alright.
The little girl's reaching up there and she's got her finger to her lips.
And the boy's standing on a stool but its gonna fall pretty soon.
He's reaching for cookies.
And the mother has her back to them.
She doesn't see them but she hasn't payed any attention to her sink.
It's running all over the place.
Her window is open and there's a nice garden and a garage out back.
She's drying some dishes.
She has an apron on.
Her dress is sleeveless.
Has a pretty nice kitchen like pretty nice curtains on it.
And the cookie jar lid is off.
She has a couple cups and she has a couple plates but she better mop up that floor.
The little girl has socks and shoes on and a short dress and medium long hair.
And the boy has his shorts on and a short sleeved shirt so it must be summer.
Trees are in bloom outside and the flowers out there.
