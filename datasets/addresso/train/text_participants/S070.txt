Beginning now?
Boy is reaching for cookies.
The stool is falling over.
His sister is reaching for cookies.
Woman's wiping the dishes.
The sink is running over.
Curtains are blowing a little bit but not much.
The boy is stepping on one of his own toes.
The little girl's telling him to "/. be quiet.
Don't let mommy see.
That's about it yeah.
