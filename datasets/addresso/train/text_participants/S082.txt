well the kids are in the corner.
They are going to get some cookies from the cookie jar.
And the mother does not see it because she's inside drying the dishes.
And the kids then just ... and I guess in the picture here that the mother that's working hard and the kids were playing.
And all of a sudden somebody turned over a dish.
And all over the floor.
Except that it did not dry it up.
It splashed from the sink but not from ... no that's no.
I'm trying to get too much out_of it.
And one of the kids is gonna get a crack on the head.
And maybe he has ... man!
It's so ... sometimes I see it very clear and other times I see /. a weak image, so to speak.
And sometimes I just have this p.
What is in here now?
But mostly is I have not so much trouble in looking at a thing at it an image but not getting anything that you'll want.
But an etch you would say it in a little.
