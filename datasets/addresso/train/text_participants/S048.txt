okay is there a number of things?
I_mean do I hafta come up with a certain amount?
Oh okay.
Okay.
Number one the boy is stealing some cookies and he's falling over from the stool that's not setting straight.
And the sink is overflowing.
You wanna know everything that's wrong with the picture or ..? everything that's happening.
Okay.
It looks like it's a nice summer day outside.
And the lady's drying the dishes.
And everything that's happening.
And she's standing in the water.
Better get out of there.
The girl seems to be giggling.
Looks like the mother is a little pissed off.
And that's about all I can see.
