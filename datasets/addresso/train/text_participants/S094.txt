Oh yes.
A little girl and the little boy is getting cookies out_of the jar.
Oh and the stool is upsetting.
And I guess it's the mother is drying dishes.
Water's spilling down all over the sink.
Water on the floor.
Little boy's gonna fall and that there stool.
I think the cookie jar is gonna fall.
And guess drying dishes and the faucet's on and water's running all over the floor.
What ..? yeah.
The cookie jar.
The stool.
Her doing the dishes.
The water spilling.
Yeah that's as far as I could see.
