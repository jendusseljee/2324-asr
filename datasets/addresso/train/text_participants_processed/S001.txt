well theres a mother standing there washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing and the windows open and outside the window theres a curved walk with a garden and you can see another building there looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden and there are two cups and a saucer on the sink and shes getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink she seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing shes also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar and the kid on the stool is gonna fall off the stool hes standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar handing them to a girl about the same age the kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine and the mother is gonna get shocked when he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down and i think thats about all
