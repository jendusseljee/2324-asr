well the children are climbing up and hes about to fall and hes getting cookies and shes telling him to sh be quiet so mother wont hear him getting up there and hes handing a cookie down to her shes washing the dishes and for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place i cant believe shes upset about the kids because she hasnt seen them maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes in other words its PAUSE shes deciding that if she did see them shes deciding that shes going to let them go ahead with it but i dont think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling i think she would have turned maybe dropped her dish but she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall and he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too and with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad threesome and the kitchen would be a mess
