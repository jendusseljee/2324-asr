okay i see a boy in the cookie jar i see he has the lid off i see that he is standing on a three legged stool and hes about to depart from that three legged stool he has one cookie in his hand handing it down to his sister and shes reaching up for it and i think shes indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesnt hear whats going on i see the mother i guess shes drying the dishes and shes not paying attention because shes leaving the sink run over and its spilling all over the floor and she must not be conscious because shes standing in it and doesnt know it i think shes probably looking out the window as i take the second look and i see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the tabletop i see the cupboards i dont know whether they all have knobs on them or not doesnt look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knobs on the cupboard door and i see outside i see apparently its a tree some shrubbery and some hedges about it
