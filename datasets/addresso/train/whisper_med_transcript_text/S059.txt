 Girl is reaching out, the boy is taking cookies out of the cookie jar. The stool is tilting. Mother is washing the dishes. The water is running over. The wind is blowing the curtains. The mother is drying the dishes. The boy is reaching down to, I guess, his sister. The boy is climbing, but he's going to fall. The mother's drying the dishes. I think I said that. The water's running and running down. That's all I see on that.
