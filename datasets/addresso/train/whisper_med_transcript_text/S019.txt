 Okay. The mother is drying the dishes, I think is overflowing. The little girl's reaching for a cookie, and her brother's taking cookies out of the cookie jar, and the stool is going to knock them on the floor. I'm going to fall on the floor because the stool is not much, whatever. The curtains are blowing, I think. All I can see.
