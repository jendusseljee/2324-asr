 Action. All right. Ladies drying dishes. The boy is, was standing on a stool, but the action is that the stool has slipped and he is falling. The girl has her hand raised, reaching for a cookie. And there's a lot of action in the sink here. The water is going out. She is apparently so distracted. Day draining, but she can't. Doesn't realize. We think is overflowing. Any more action? There's enough action.
