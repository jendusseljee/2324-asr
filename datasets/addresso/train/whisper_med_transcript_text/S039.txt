 Do I start? The children are getting into the cookie jar, which is on the high above the sink. They have the lid off the cookie jar. The boy has two in his hand, and the girl's reaching up for them, and the stool in which he's standing is about to upset. Of course, the door is open to get the cookie jar. The mother, presumably, is at the sink washing dishes, and the sink is running over the water splashing down on the floor. There are two, I suppose, dry dishes on the sink. She has one in her hand a plate that she is drying. She has it on an apron. And the sink is below a window with a path out into a garden. There are shrubbery to the left of the path. And you can see beyond that another window. And I don't know what that is. There are flowers who reads. And this is part of the house. You can see the roof of maybe an elevator. the house and the curtains. All the curtains are drawn back.
