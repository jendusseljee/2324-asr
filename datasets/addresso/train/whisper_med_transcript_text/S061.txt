 All right, the boy is getting into the cookie jar. He's got one in his hand, but stool was falling over as he's reaching for the cookies. The girl is laughing at him. Mother is standing by the kitchen sink, drying dishes. The water is on, and the sink is spilling over. There is a window over the sink, which shows a yard. There are curtains. There are, looks like two cups and a plate on the sink. There's a set of kitchen cabinets. The mother has on an apron and a sleeve of the stress. The girl has on a dress or a skirt and blouse. The boy looks like he's got on short trousers and a shirt with a sweater. Cookie jars full of cookies. The lid is off.
