 There is a boy on the stool. The stool is tipping over. A boy is taking cookies out of the jar. The cupboard is open. The girl is saying putting their finger to her mouth. Also putting her hand out for a cookie. The mother is washing dishes. Water is stealing over from the sink onto the floor. There's two cups in the saucer on the sink. And the key is stepping on the water on the floor. she is drying the dishes and she is looking outside at the plow. This is shrubbery. The boy is handing the girl a cookie.
