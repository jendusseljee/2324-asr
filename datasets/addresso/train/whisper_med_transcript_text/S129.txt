 Well, the kid's up taking cookies out of the cookie jar. The other one's there holding her hand. The jar is going to fall. She's washing dishes and forgot to turn the sink off. Water's going all over the floor. That dishes are on the sink. It looks like a face laying in a yard, the way the grass is. That's what we got. You're taking cookies out of the cookie jar. The kid has her hand up after it. Mama's washing dishes. Sinks running over. That's it. Wind is open.
