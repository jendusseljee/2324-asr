 The girls making fun of the boys. She made fun so much while he was stealing a cookie on a cookie jar and it made him trip and he's going to follow the mothers listening to the kids. She's drying dishes. Get the window and gets a mirror and she's paying attention to the sink. The sink spilling water onto the floor is getting her feet wet. The curtains are open. To allow fresh air to come in the house, there's two cups on the dish on the sink. The faucets are open and the cupboard doors open. Looks like it might be summer. Spring or summer or because things look like they're growing outside. She has shoes on, she has shoes on, he has shoes on, she has shoes on. The lids up the cookie jar. There's a fancy thick cabinet over here, a fancy wall cabinet over there. That's about it.
