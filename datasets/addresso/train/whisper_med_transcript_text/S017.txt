 I see the mother doing the dishes, the sink, the water running over in the sink. The boy's taking cookies from the cookie jar and the stool is falling over and the little girl has her hands up to her mouth, in other words, to be quiet. The stool's falling out. That's it. He has her hand up for him to pass her a cooking and be quiet. Mother's the dish and she's sitting there. Yeah, okay.
