The mother was at the sink, and the sink splashing over the sink, and she's sort of a little bit bitchy. Water's going and flooding over the sink. The mother's looking out the window.

The chair's crooked. What the hell else? He's looking out. The window, the window is open. She's not paying any attention to the kids. The water is flooding over the sink. What else you want?
