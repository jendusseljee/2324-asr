 You ready? Well, the sink is overflowing. Mother is standing in the water like a jerk. She's wiping the dishes also like a jerk. The boy is trying to get a cookie out of the cookie jar, but boy, he's about to fall off the stool. His sister has her hand up. She's saying, Shh, to be quiet, Mother, know what you're doing. And he's about to hand her a cookie, but in a few moments it's going to be like total catastrophe. mother the reason the water is flowing out over the sink is because the water is running furiously um and i'm looking out through the window and i don't see anything going on out there unless i don't that's just a bush i'm presuming or a plum pudding um i told you the stool is about to go over in the moment there's going to be real chaos what's going on the picture look like nothing the cookie jar is full the cookie jar that you want me to tell you all those things tell me all the things you see going on in the paper the cabinet door has just swung open and stools of about the fall, I guess I've told you that, with a terrible crash. Mother is daydreaming. She doesn't even know what's going on behind her. I think that's very important and sometimes typical.
