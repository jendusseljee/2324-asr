 Okay. The mother's washing the dishes and they're flowing. I don't know any on the side is she on a little boy who's full as are into the street. This water all the floor. The garden is outside and the mother's not paying attention to what they do. School is tipping. But we are the door is open. The breeze is closed open. And the little girl saying finger to her mouth can tell mother, you give me, already have been bright. Mother's stepping the water and she always said children are doing things. Okay, good.
