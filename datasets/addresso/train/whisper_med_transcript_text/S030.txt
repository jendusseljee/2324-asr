 Okay, the little boy is on a stool about to fall. The stool is about to upset, and the water is running over into the dishpan there or into the sink, and the lady is standing there drying a dish. Two cups and a plate are on the counter there. And out the window, there's a walkway, and you can see a window across from the walkway here. Great. Okay, that's what's happening, I guess.
