 Okay, we see a little boy climbed up on a stool reaching for a cookie jar, and the stool is about to, or is falling. He is trying to get a cookie for himself, and also one for his sister. His sister is telling him to be very quiet. She's going, shh. I can't write that down. I don't need to be quiet. And in the meantime, the mother is washing the dishes, or washing dishes. And the sink has overflowed and is pouring water on the floor. I don't think I see anything else.
