 I see he has a little hockseat that he is standing on a three-legged stool and he's about to depart from that three-legged stool. And I think she's indicating the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear us. I see the mother. I guess she's drying the dishes. He's not paying attention because she's a little sink run over and a spin him all over the floor. She must not be conscious because she's standing and doesn't know it. Um, I think she must, I think she's probably looking out the windows. Take the second look and I see wearing a couple of dirty dishes on the tabletop. I see the cupboards. I know whether they all have knobs on them or not. Doesn't look like the two of the boy and the girl have knocked on the covered door. And I see outside that.
