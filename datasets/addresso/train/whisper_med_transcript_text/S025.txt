 Water running out of the sink. Lady drying a plate. I'm a child getting cookies out of a cookie jar. Standing on a stool that is tipping over. A little girl reaching up for a cookie. And, um, curtains at the window. A path outside. Tree. A window into another room. Shrubbery. Grass. Let's get back to the room again. Cup cups and a plate sitting on the countertop. Covers. Tadernage you have them. Sink. Fosset. With water running out of it. An opening window behind her. Sink. Tieback curtains. I'm sorry.
