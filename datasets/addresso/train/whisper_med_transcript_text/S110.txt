 Honey, I would have had it was in the kitchen, and I was the oldest hen. And if we made a mess like that, you'd get a kick in the ass. Well, we have a filling of the water, and the kid went his cookie jar, and a stool is turned over, and the mother's running the water on the floor. And I know what else you want from that? Looks like somebody's laying out in the grass, doesn't it? And the kid in the cookie jar and a tilted stool. What more do you want? All right. Water rolling on the floor.
