 The girl is watching the boy go into the cooking jar. He has a cooking in his hand. He's on the stool. The stool is falling. The mother's drying dishes. Has a plate in her hand. It makes his own flowing. There's water on the floor. Stepping in the water. What's going on? The little girl looks like she's motioning to the boy. The woman's looking out the window. The hand is open.
