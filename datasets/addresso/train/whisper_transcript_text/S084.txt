 all right i see the little boy stealing cookies from the cookie jar and the little girls and he gave some to the little girl and she's eating some of them and i guess this is mama and she's washing the dishes and she dropped a dish no no she didn't drop it share the water that she's washing the dishes but she left run and it's overflown oh for fun oh it doesn't that doesn't sound right no i forgot to turn off the spigot. So the water is coming off onto the floor here. And Mama apparently is washing the dishes. And here's this little boy stealing the cookie. He's going to fall because his server, or the bench that he's four-legged, stooled, whatever it is, is going to fall over in the cookie jar. Mama's drying the dishes. They don't have a husband that dries them or washes them or whatever. Uh, let's see now. I guess there's more things I'm supposed to see. Seeing here now. Oh, uh, the water is flowing out of this thing. They forgot to turn off whoever's doing the dish washing. Girl is pushed over the chair with the boy that he was reaching up to get the cookies. And I, either she pushed it over or he... Oh, excuse me
