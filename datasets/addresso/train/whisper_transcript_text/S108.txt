 And tell me, and... The water? Well, let's see. There's something has to be where the water goes down over. There's probably something that... Or they don't have it open, or... I don't know. When the water goes down, what do you call that? This here. Right here. This. What do you call that? What is that? What is that? I don't know. That's what I'm saying. I don't know. That's what I'm saying. I don't know what that is. What? A pipe. Oh, oh, oh. Water pipe. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, then maybe the water pipe is broke. Or not broke, but there must be things in there. I don't know. What's happening to the water? Well, the water is going down in the... What would you call this? Floor, floor, floor. Yeah, okay, okay. Down on this side of the picture. This thing here is turning over. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. Well, he's probably getting... What's this here? Coco jar. What's this cocoa? C-O-O-K-I-E. I don't know. Coco jar. Oh, okay. Well, he's getting it out, and he's going to give it to the girl. Is there anything going on in the picture? Well, the boy giving him the girl the cocoa. This probably is broke, so the water will not go down in, and it's coming up and going in here. It looks like she was, she was gonna wash, what do you call it? What do you call this? Plate, a plate. Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What you eat in, is that what you call them, a plate? Oh, this is a cup? Mm-hmm.
