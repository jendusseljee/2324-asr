 The girl is watching the boy go into the cooking jar. He has a cook in his hand. He's on the stool. The stool is falling. The mother is drying dishes. She has a plate in her hand. It makes his elbow glowing. There's water on the floor. Stepping in the water. What's going on? The little girl looks like she's motioning to the boy in the corner. The woman's looking out the window. The door's open.
