 There is a boy on the stool. The stool is tipping over. The boy is taking cookies out of the jar. The cupboard is open. The girler on the sink and the key is stepping on the water on the floor and she is drying the dishes and she is looking outside at the cloud. There's shrubbery. The boy is handing the girl a cookie.
