 Well, one thing, this boy's on the stool getting cookies. His stool's about to fall, and the little girl's reaching for some cookies. She got a finger in her mouth. Mother's drying dishes, and water's running over. She's drying dishes, water's running over. She's standing in the water. There's a sink there, plate, cup. I said, the cookery job would have to be in the cupboard. And there's a car in there, coming around in the kitchen.
