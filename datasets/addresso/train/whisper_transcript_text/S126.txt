 I don't see no Muslim. I don't see no Muslim. Somebody took the pencil and went up. I see a girl standing there. There's a little box or something on there. All over here. Some kind of little flower. And a girl is there. There's something. There's another girl. Looks like a little girl is in there. Box and things. Looking about the same. I'm sorry I didn't bring my glasses.
