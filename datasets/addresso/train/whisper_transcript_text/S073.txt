 Well, the boy's trying to get in the cookie jar and the stool overturns and the little girl is expecting to hand her a cookie. The mother's sink is running over and she's standing in some of the water and she's drying a dish or wiping a dish and she said everything is happening. Well, the water is still running in the sink. I said it's overflowing and she's standing in the water and that's, I guess.
