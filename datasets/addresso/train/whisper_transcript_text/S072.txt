 I mean right now, I tell you. The boy is stealing cookies out of the jar. He's on a stool that's falling down, and the girl is laughing at him, and the mother is washing dishes, but she's preoccupied, and the water is flowing over the sink, and there's trouble galore. The wind is blowing the curtains. She is not paying any attention to her kids, and the boy, in addition to stealing, he's trying to give the girl a cookie. And, uh, the whole thing is gonna collapse. Uh, but aside from that, they seem to be a fairly happy family.
