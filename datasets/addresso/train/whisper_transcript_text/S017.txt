 I see the mother doing the dishes, the sink, the water running over in the sink, the boys taking cookies from the cookie jar, and the stool is falling over, and the little girl has her hands up to her mouth, in other words, to be quiet. And the stool's falling out. That's it. She has her hand up for him to pass her a cookie. Then be quiet. Mother's doing the dishes. Yeah, okay.
