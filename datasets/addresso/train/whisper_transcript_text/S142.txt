 This boy over here standing on the chair is falling over. The girl down below, the boy's up there, has a cookie jar up there. He's putting cookies in it. The thing's falling over. Then there's the lady. She's washing dishes and drying them. The sink turned on, and the water's running down. It's running on the floor, and she's standing in the water. She's got a dress on, and she's looking out the water. She's got a dress on and she's looking out out past drapes down here. And she's looking out through the window. Looks like that buoy's gonna fall over pretty soon.
