 We'll start with the girl. She's going to see a cookie. Her brother is taking cookies out of a jar. He got careless. He's asking him for one. So he's handing one down to her. The mother's not paying much attention. She's looking out. Okay. And Carter. The outside looks all right. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, I'm mixed up. We've got fire. She's drying a dish. And he has two cups and a plate on the table. A tree. And I climbed a tree. There's an angle here that is incomplete. A corner where they all come together. Child and hospital.

Oh, I did say she's letting the water run over this thing, didn't I? Yes. She's looking out the window. Well, it's... How about that?
