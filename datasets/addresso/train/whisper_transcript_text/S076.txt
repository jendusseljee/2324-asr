 A lot of things are happening. Yes, the water's going over. The water's overflowing. And the little boy is slipping off the stool while he's trying to fill some cookies. And the little girl is laughing at him, and she's not helping him, but in debt. And the lady is drying the dishes and looking out to wind there. Beautiful out there. Must be June. I don't know, but anyhow, it looks like it's not winter. That's about all I can see.
