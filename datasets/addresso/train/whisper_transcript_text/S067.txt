 Okay, the boy is taking cookies out of the closet. One hand trying to give the cookies to his sister with another while he is falling off a three-pronged stool. His mother is washing dishes and the dishwasher is overflowing onto the floor and the curtains are billowing. The girl is eating or lying. Difficult to tell. That's the only action I can see.
