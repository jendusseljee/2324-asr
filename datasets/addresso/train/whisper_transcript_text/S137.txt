 the woman of the house is drying the dishes. Her sink is overflowing. The boy's stool is tipping. He's taking cookies out of a jar. He's handing one to his sister. And he goes, oh, she's already dried some dishes right here, I guess. What is this, honey? I can't make that out. It looks like, oh, action. Oh, I'm sorry. She's drying the dishes. You stand in water. That's action. And Oh, I'm sorry. You're trying to do this? You're standing in water. That's action. And the door is open. Where the cookies are. They all have their shoes on. Oh, she's got an apron on over her dress. Kind of homely girl, isn't she? Not doing much. She's just got her hand like... How many did I get wrong?
