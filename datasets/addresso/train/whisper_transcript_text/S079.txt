 There's a young boy going in a cookie jar, and there's a little girl, young girl, and I'm saying he's a boy because it's hard to tell anymore. He's in a cookie jar, and there's a stool that he is on, and it already is starting to fall over, and so is the water in the sink. It's overflowing in the sink. I don't know about the, this hickey here, whether that's more than one I said. I like the, the wife or I mean the, the mother is near the girl and she's, uh, she has, uh, I can't think of the, she has the, she's trying to wipe, wipe dishes and stop the water from going out.
