 This boy is almost falling off of the chair when he's putting up the picture. And he's washing dishes. Oh, my. I think he's running over, too, isn't it? Is that out more or is there more to it? This one looks pretty like a plate, I guess. And a cup and saucer. Oh, this is a lady here, is it or isn't it? Right there. Is that a lady? When I had it this way, it looked almost like a lady here, is it or isn't it? Right there, is that a lady? When I had it this way it looked almost like a lady. She's washing dishes and she must have dropped one. Oh no, the sink ran over. And he's almost falling off of the chair.
