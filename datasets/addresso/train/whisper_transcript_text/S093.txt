 I found the children are climbing up the stairs. And she's telling me to be quiet so no one will hear it. They won't hear I'm getting up there. She said, look, she's in the dishes. For some reason she didn't turn and go back to the ceiling. In other words, she used to say that she did see them, but she would have known that she would have dropped her shirt. But she was up close to the water on the floor.
