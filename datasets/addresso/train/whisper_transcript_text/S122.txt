 Oh, sure. The little girl's standing in the kitchen, and the little boy steps on a chair to get some cookies, and he's about to fall down. And his mother isn't aware of it yet. She's still washing dishes, and then the sink ran over, I guess, when she got excited. And it's going down on the floor in the kitchen, and she's trying to dry the dishes, and she's just standing there. Still has dishes to go, I guess. And this little boy is about to to fall and this little girl is smiling at him because he's going for the cookies in the cookie jar.
