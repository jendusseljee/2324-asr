 Everything's happening. Going on. Mm-hmm. Well, this is the boy trying to get the cookie jar done. This jar I wanted. And he's gonna fall off the ladder, off the stool, or wherever he's set. Mother's over here. She just dropped some water or whatever on the floor. He looks pretty mad. And the water's still running. And it looks like the girl is laughing at the boy because the stool's gonna fall over. And there's water on the floor there.
