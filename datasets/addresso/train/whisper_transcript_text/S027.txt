 I don't know if you can picture one. One is boys on a stool getting cookies from a cookie jar and giving them to a girl, but the stool is about ready to tip over. The mother is drying the dishes and the sink faucet has filled the sink bowl and is running over onto the floor. That's all the action I see.
