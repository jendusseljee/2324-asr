 All the eggs. Just go ahead and tell you. The mother is drying a plate. The water sink is clogged, so there's more water going over it, and it's splashing onto the floor. And the boy's falling off the stool, getting cookies from the cookie jar. And the girl's putting her finger up to her foot, which means I won't tell or something like that. Shoes are getting wet in the mother. I'm looking outside. I don't see it doing anything. Doesn't it snowing? There's too much snow in the back. What about the reaction I see is the water spilling over and the boy falling off the stool? I don't know that snow is action. I don't see it snowing. It looks white out there.
