 it's a kitchen scene, and the mother is doing the dishes. The children are trying to get into the cookie jar. The stool is falling over. The water is running over in the sink. It looks as though the window is open. It looks like the curtains might be billowing a little. The little girl is asking the boy for a cookie. And let's see, the mother is drying the dishes. And she's standing in the water. Looks like there are a couple dishes that have already been dried sitting on the sink. I guess that's all I see. Pardon me? I'm in a mess over there. Oh, I said the little boy's trying to get some cookies out of the cookie jar. The little girl's asking for a cookie, and the stool looks as though it's going to fall over.
