 The little boy is up on this thing here, and he's up trying to get something out of the garden selection, I think it is. The little girl, I think, is mad because she didn't get some of it. And here's Mama drying the dishes. Just the little girl and the boy was on here. The little girl and the boy. She's reaching up to the boy, and the boy is about his other hand down. Anything else? No, that's all. She spilled something I think from the sink down. It came splashing down. That's the first I noticed it. I'm terrible anymore.
