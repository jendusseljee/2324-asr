 The boy is taking cookies from the cookie jar, giving one to his sister, also falling off the stool he is on. The mother is washing dishes, letting the sink overflow, getting all over the floor. I see nothing. The girl is saying, quiet. That counts. I don't know what the mother gets by standing in order. That's all I see. Thank you.
