 I don't see a chance to... Somebody's doing...drying dishes. Someone's standing on a stool and the stool is getting ready to fall over. Hmm... I think somebody's drying dishes. Now I don't see anything else going on over here. I'm thinking now maybe the water's overrunning. I'm not too sure. There's some water on the floor here. And there's something in the sink that's overrunning me.
