 Okay, is there a number of things? I mean, do I have to come up with a certain amount? Oh, okay. Number one, the boy is stealing some cookies and he's falling over from the chair that's not sitting straight. And the sink is overflowing. Do you want to know everything that's wrong with the picture or anything? Everything that's happened. Okay. It looks like it's a nice summer day outside. The lady's drying the dishes and everything that's happening. She's standing in the water. The girl seems to be giggling. Looks like the mother is a little PO'd. And, what the hell?
