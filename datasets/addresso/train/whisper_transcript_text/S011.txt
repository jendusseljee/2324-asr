 Girl, boy, a stool, cookies, cookie jar, open closet, curtain, what's going on? The little boy's reaching for the cookies and the stool is falling over. He's laughing. He's waiting for the cookie. Mother's frying dishes. The water's spilling over. I see a view from the outside. He's drinking some drops. He's wiping the towel. Anymore?
