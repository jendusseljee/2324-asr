what's going on in the picture?
PAR: Well the children are climbing up and he's about to fall.
PAR: And he's getting cookies.
PAR: And she's telling him to sh be quiet so mother won't hear him getting up there.
PAR: And he's handing a cookie down to her.
PAR: She's washing the dishes.
PAR: And for some reason she must have been upset about something because she is letting the water run out all over the place.
PAR: I can't believe she's upset about the kids because she hasn't seen them.
PAR: Maybe she did turn and look at them and then go back to the dishes.
.
PAR: In other words it's ... she's deciding that if she did see them she's deciding that she's going to let them go ahead with it.
PAR: But I don't think she would have let them go ahead if she saw the little boy falling.
PAR: I think she would have turned.
PAR: Maybe dropped her dish.
PAR: But she would have gotten hold of him and saved him from being harmed in the fall.
PAR: And he might just pull all the cookie jar with him when he falls too.
.
PAR: And with the water on the floor and the cookie jar on the floor it would be a sad /. bad.
PAR: Threesome and the kitchen would be a mess.
INV: Mhm.
