tell me everything that you see going on in that picture.
INV: Everything that you see happening.
PAR: Well there's a mother standing there washing the dishes and the sink is overflowing.
PAR: And the window's open.
PAR: And outside the window there's a curved walk with a garden.
PAR: And you can see another building there.
PAR: Looks like a garage or something with curtains and the grass in the garden.
PAR: And there are two cups and a saucer on the sink.
PAR: And she's getting her feet wet from the overflow of the water from the sink.
PAR: She seems to be oblivious to the fact that the sink is overflowing.
PAR: She's also oblivious to the fact that her kids are stealing cookies out of the cookie jar.
PAR: And the kid on the stool is gonna fall off the stool.
PAR: He's standing up there in the cupboard taking cookies out of the jar, handing them to a girl about the same age.
PAR: The kids are somewhere around seven or eight years old or nine.
PAR: And the mother is gonna get shocked when he tumbles and the cookie jar comes down.
PAR: And I think that's about all.
