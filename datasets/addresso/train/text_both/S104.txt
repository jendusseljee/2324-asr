INV: Okay.
INV: All of the action.
PAR: Okay, I see a boy in the cookie jar.
PAR: I see he has the lid off.
PAR: I see that he is standing on a three legged stool and he's about to depart from that three legged stool.
PAR: He has one cookie in his hand, handing it down to his sister and she's reaching up for it.
PAR: And I think she's indicating to the boy to keep still so his mother doesn't hear what's going on.
PAR: I see the mother.
PAR: I guess she's drying the dishes and she's not paying attention because she's leaving the sink run over and it's spilling all over the floor.
PAR: And she must not be conscious because she's standing in it and doesn't know it.
PAR: I think she's probably looking out the window as I take the second look.
PAR: And I see apparently a couple dirty dishes on the tabletop.
PAR: I see the cupboards.
PAR: I don't know whether they all have knobs on them or not.
PAR: Doesn't look like the two where the boy and the girl are have knobs on the cupboard door.
PAR: And I see outside.
PAR: I see apparently it's a tree, some shrubbery and some hedges.
INV: Okay?
PAR: About it?
INV: Okay good.
